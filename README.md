# TOPMed analysis pipeline

## Setup

We recommend building R with [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl) for improved performance in PC-Relate and association tests.

1. Install R packages and dependencies from Bioconductor  
```{r}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("SeqVarTools", "SNPRelate", "GENESIS", "argparser", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "GGally"))
```
2. Install updated GENESIS from github  
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("smgogarten/GENESIS")
```
3. Install TopmedPipeline R package  
```
R CMD INSTALL TopmedPipeline
```

## Basic outline

Each script in the `R` directory takes a config file with parameters. Look at the beginning of each script for parameter lists. Some parameters are required; others are optional with default values.

Some scripts can be run in parallel by chromosome. For these scripts, the chromosome number is given as an argument: `"--chromosome 22"` (or `"-c 22"`). If running in parallel, include a space in file names in the config file where chromosome should be inserted, e.g.,
```
gds_file "1KG_phase3_subset_chr .gds"
```

Nearly all scripts require a GDS file in SeqArray format. Phenotype files should be an AnnotatedDataFrame saved in an RData file. See `?AnnotatedDataFrame` or the SeqVarTools documentation for details. Example files are provided in `testdata`.

Python scripts are provided to run multi-step analyses on a compute cluster or cloud environment. `TopmedPipeline.py` defines cluster environment classes, currently a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) cluster, Amazon's cfncluster Son of Grid Engine (also SGE), and AWS Batch. Additional classes may be added for other environments. Default cluster options are provided in the JSON file `cluster_cfg.json`. These options may be overridden at run time by specifying a JSON file with the `--cluster_file` option in the python scripts. Only options that should be changed from the default need to be included in the file. See `custom_cluster_cfg.json` for an example.

These python scripts require a config argument `out_prefix` in addition to the arguments for each R script called. Some input and output file name parameters are overridden by the scripts in order to link jobs together. Example config files are in `testdata`.

Python script arguments are shown below. Note: not all arguments are available in all scripts, and some scripts may have additional arguments. Run with `-h` or `--help` to see details for a particular script.

argument  | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
`config_file` | | configuration file
`--cluster_type` | `UW_Cluster` | type of compute cluster environment (`UW_Cluster`, `AWS_Cluster`, `AWS_Batch`)
`--cluster_file` | `None` | JSON file containing cluster options
`-c, --chromosomes` | `1-23` | range of chromosomes (23=X)
`-n, --ncores` | `1-8` | number of cores to use; either a number (e.g, 1) or a range of numbers (e.g., 1-4)
`-e, --email` | `None` | email address to receive job completion report
`--print_only` | `False` | print job submission commands without submitting them
`--verbose` | `False` | verbose messages for debugging
`-h, --help` | | print help message and exit

## Conversion to GDS

`vcf2gds.py`

1. `vcf2gds.R`
2. `merge_gds.R`
3. `unique_variant_ids.R`

config parameter | default value | description
--- | --- | ---
`out_prefix` | | Prefix for files created by this script.
`vcf_file` | | Input VCF file. Include a space to insert chromosome.
`gds_file` | | Output GDS file. Include a space to insert chromosome.
`merged_gds_file` | | Merged genotype-only GDS file containing all chromosomes.
`format` | `GT` | FORMAT fields from the VCF to convert to GDS. Default is genotypes only.

Step 1 converts VCF files (one per chromosome) into GDS files, discarding non-genotype FORMAT fields. (BCF files may be used instead of VCF if [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) is installed.) Step 2 combines these files into a single GDS file, which is needed for whole-genome analyses such as relatedness and population structure. The single-chromosome files are still preferred for analyses run in parallel by chromosome. Step 3 ensures that each variant has a unique integer ID across the genome, so the variant.id field in the per-chromosome files and the combined file are consistent.

### GRM

An as alternative to separating recent relatedness from ancestry, one can compute a Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM).

The GRM is calculated for each chromosome separately, and then averaged to create the final GRM.

`variant_include_file` | `NA` | RData file with vector of variant.id to consider.


## Association testing

Association tests are done with a mixed model if a kinship matrix (`pcrelate_file`) is given in the config file. If `pcrelate_file` is `NA` or missing, testing is done with a fixed effects model.

When combining samples from groups with different variances for a trait (e.g., study or ancestry group), it is recommended to allow the null model to fit heterogeneous variances by group using the parameter `group_var`. The default pipeline options will then result in the following procedure:

1. For all samples together:
    1. Fit null mixed model with outcome variable
	    - Allow heterogeneous variance by `group_var`
        - Include covariates and PCs as fixed effects
        - Include kinship as random effect
2. For each group separately:
    1. Inverse normal transform marginal residuals (if `inverse_normal = TRUE`)
    2. Rescale variance to match original (if `rescale_variance = "marginal"` or `"varcomp"`)
3. For all samples together:
    1. Fit null mixed model using transformed residuals as outcome
        - Allow heterogeneous variance by `group_var`
        - Include covariates and PCs as fixed effects (if `resid_covars = TRUE`)
        - Include kinship as random effect

For single-variant tests, the effect estimate is for the reference allele. For aggregate and sliding window tests, the effect estimate is for the alternate alelle, and multiple alternate alelles for a single variant are treated separately.

Association tests have an additional level of parallelization: by segment within chromosome. The R scripts take an optional `"--segment"` (or `"-s"`) argument. The python script `assoc.py` uses the environment variable `SGE_TASK_ID` to submit jobs by segment for each chromosome. By default each segment is 10 Mb in length, but this may be changed by using the arguments `"--segment_length"` or `"--n_segments"`. Note that `"--n_segments"` defines the number of segments for the entire genome, so using this argument with selected chromosomes may result in fewer segments than you expect (and the minimum is one segment per chromosome).

`window_step` | `20` | Step size of sliding window in kb.


### Parallelization details

The segment file created at the start of each association test contains the chromosome, start, and end position for each segment. R scripts for association testing each take chromosome and segment as arguments.

* Single-variant: only variants within in the segment are selected.
* Aggregate: aggregate units where the first variant is within the segment are selected. This ensures that each unit is tested exactly once.
* Sliding window: the length of the segment is increased by `window.size` before selecting variants. This ensures that all possible windows are tested. When the segments are combined into a single file for each chromosome, duplicate windows are discarded. Since the `assocTestSeqWindow` function defines windows starting at position 1, the windows tested when parallelizing by segment are identical to the windows tested when running an entire chromosome in one job.

The script [`assoc.py`](assoc.py) submits a SGE array job for each chromosome, where the SGE task id is the row number of the segment in the segments file. If a segment has no requested variants, its job will exit without error. After all segments are complete, they are combined into a single file for each chromosome and the temporary per-segment output files are deleted.



## LocusZoom

LocusZoom plots are created with the [LocusZoom standalone software](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LocusZoom_Standalone).

Loci to plot are specified in the `locus_file`, with chromosome `chr` and either `variantID` (to specify the reference variant) or `start end` (to indicate a region to plot, in which case the variant with the smallest p-value will be the reference. Population (`pop`) is either `TOPMED` or one of the 1000 Genomes populations (`hg19`:`AFR`, `AMR`, `ASN`, `EUR`; `hg38`: `AFR`, `AMR`, `EUR`, `EAS`, `SAS`). If `pop = TOPMED`, LD is computed from the TOPMed data using the sample set in `ld_sample_include`.

Regions from sliding window or aggregate tests with p-values below a certain threshold can be displayed in a separate track.
